# Odin-recipes

Hi there 🙋‍♂️!!!
It is time to practice all of the HTML knowledge that I have acquired.
In this project I am going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to
a few recipes. The website won't look very pretty by the time I finish.
But it is important to keep in mind that this project is just to build
and improve my HTML Skills.
